Being an introduction class, the course was very hand-held and provided a lot of guidance throughout the development of the website. The course took things step-by-step, beginning with `HTML`, then `CSS`, and ending with `JavaScript` integrate all components of the website. 

Basics were first introduced, such as implementing headers and text, and then progressed into adding images, links, different fonts and colors, and eventually into creating working buttons and modals. 

Throughout the course, we were also taught supplemental techniques that would improve our quality of scripting, such as debugging techniques utilizing the developer tools in Chrome.
This course has introduced many foundational terms and understandings that I am grateful for and will help me understand the workings of a website better than when I started.
